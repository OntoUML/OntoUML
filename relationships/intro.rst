Introduction
============

**Relations** are entities that glue together other entities. Every
relation has a number of **relata** as arguments, which are connected or
related by it. The number of a relation’s arguments is called its arity.
As much as an unary property such as *being Red,* properties of higher
arities such as *being married-to, being heavier-than* are universals,
since they can be predicated of a multitude of individuals. Relations
can be classified according to the types of their relata. There are
relations between sets, between individuals, and between universals, but
there are also cross-categorical relations, for example, between
urelements and sets or between sets and universals. We divide relations
into two broad categories, called `material </ufo/wiki/material/>`__
and \ `formal </ufo/wiki/formal/>`__ relations. *Formal relations* hold
between two or more entities directly without any further intervening
individual. Examples of formal relations are:

-  5 is *greater than* 3
-  this day *is part of* this month
-  N is *subset of* Q

but also the relations of instantiation, inherence, quale of a
quality, association, existential dependence, among others –
… relations that form the mathematical superstructure of our
framework. … \ *Material relations,* conversely, have material structure
on their own and include examples such as:

-  employments
-  kisses
-  enrollments
-  flight connections
-  commitments

The relata of a material relation are mediated by individuals that are
called `relators </ufo/wiki/relator/>`__\ **.** Relators are individuals
with the power of connecting entities:

-  *a flight connection,* for example, founds a relator that connects
   airports
-  *an enrollment* is a relator that connects a student with an
   educational institution…

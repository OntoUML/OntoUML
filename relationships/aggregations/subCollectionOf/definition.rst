«:ref:`subCollectionOf`» is a parthood relation between two collectives. Examples
include:

A. the north part of the Black Forest is part of the Black Forest;
B. the collection of Jokers in a deck of cards is part of that deck of cards;
C. the collection of forks in cutlery set is part of that cutlery set;
D. the collection of male individuals in a crowd is part of that crowd.

The subCollectionOf relation can be **shareable** in
some cases while **non-shareable** in others. For example, the Kulik
siblings is a collection of three members: Marie, Vaclav, and Karel. The
same Kulik siblings are sub-collection of the Kulik family, as well as a
sub-collection of the FC Bilsko football team, as well as a
sub-collection of the Voluntary Firefighter Unit in Bilsko. On contrary,
the local organization of the Agrarian Party in Borovno is a
sub-collection of the Agrarian Party, but must not be a sub-collection
of any other political party, because the statutes prohibit it.
«:ref:`collective`» is a type of collections (and
collections are instances of collectives). Collection is an *integral
whole,* or closure defined by a *unifying relation.* Closure means that
no more parts or members can be added to the collection by its unifying
relation.

Unlike «:ref:`quantity`», «:ref:`collective`» have
members and their members may not be placed together (or connected
*topologically*), but unified *intentionally* e.g. by the common role,
or purpose, or social connection. Closure of the unifying relation makes
the collective *maximal,* e.g. the football team is made up of all its
members and no subset of its members can make up the same team. For this
reason, the subQuantityOf relation is **irreflexive**. Moreover, for the
same reason, any super-collective can have at maximum one sub-collective
of a given type. Finally, since every sub-collective of a
super-collective is obtained by refining the unifying relation of the
latter, the subCollectionOf relation is always **transitive**. Since
collections are *maximal*, the subCollectionOf parthood must have a
**cardinality constraint of one and exactly one** in the sub-collection
side. Addition or removal of a sub-collection (or even a member) of a
collection may or may not change identity of the collection. E.g. new
firefighter units are taken in the National Rescue System and some of
the existing units cease to exist without changing identity of the
National Rescue System. Similarly, the Voluntary Firefighter Unit in
Karlik consists of three members: Velebil, Strasirybka, and Jech. Then
Veselik applies for membership and is taken in the firefighter unit. It
is still the same unit, its identity does not change. On contrary,
imagine: Jarmila and Jaroslav are spouses. If Jaroslav died, the spousal
will cease to exist. And the unifying relation of spousal does not even
admit changing Jaroslav for Karel -- such a change would change the
identity of the spousal, as well. This means that collectives are not
*extensional* (but *intentional*). That is why only the **weak
supplementation axiom** holds for the subCollectionOf relation (unlike
the «:ref:`subQuantityOf`» relation, where the *strong supplementation axiom*
holds). This axiom means among others that every super-collection must
have at least two different types of sub-collections.

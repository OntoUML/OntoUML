SubQuantityOf is a parthood relation between two quantities, e.g.:
alcohol is part of wine; plasma is part of blood; sugar is part of ice
cream. `Quantities </ufo/wiki/quantity/>`__ have not elements (or
members). Since their members cannot be enumerated, they must be defined
by a relation that unifies them into a connected whole
(self-connectedness). Quantities are connected *topologically* (unlike
e.g. collectives, which parts and members may not be placed together).
*Topological connection* is characteristic for quantities and because of
*topological connection,* sub-quantities cannot be shared among several
super-quantities. For this reason, a subQuantityOf relation is always
**non-sharable.** Since quantities do not have elements, they can be
arbitrarily divided, like e.g. water. That´s why any quantity is defined
to be *maximal portion* and can not be part of itself (water cannot be
part of water). Since every part of a quantity is maximal (and
self-connected), the SubQuantityOf parthood must have a **cardinality
constraint of one and exactly one** in the sub-quantity side. E.g. since
alcohol is a quantity (and, hence, maximal), there is exactly one
quantity of alcohol which is part of a specific quantity of wine. Since
quantity is *maximal,* it cannot have a quantity of the same kind as its
part -- i.e. the SubQuantityOf relation is **irreflexive.**
Nevertheless, a quantity can be part of another quantity (like glucose
in wine) using the SubQuantityOf relation. The change of any of parts of
the quantity changes the identity of the whole (i.e. quantities are
*extensional* entities). That is why **the strong supplementation
axiom** holds for the the subQuantityOf relations (unlike
`SubCollectionOf </ufo/wiki/part-whole-relation/subcollectionof/>`__
relation, which on contrary holds only weaker axiom). For the same
reason, all parts of a quantity are **essential** and subQuantityOf
relations are essential parthood relations. Further, since essential
parthood relations are always transitive, subQuantityOf is always
**transitive**.

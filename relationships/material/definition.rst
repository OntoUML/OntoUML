Definition
----------

«:ref:`material`» relations have material structure on their own and include
examples such as employments, kisses, enrollments, flight, connections
and commitments. The **relata** of a material relation are mediated by
individuals that are called relators. Relators («:ref:`relator`») are individuals with the
power of connecting entities; a flight connection, for example, founds a
relator that connects airports, an enrollment is a relator that connects
a student with an educational institution. Relators play an important
role in answering questions of the sort: what does it mean to say that
John is married to Mary? Why is it true to say that Bill works for
Company X but not for Company Y?.

**Material relations** are derived (via «:ref:`derivation`»)
from relators and the mediation relations that connect them to the
corresponding relata. Cardinality constraints of mediation relations
collapse by derivation. Material relations are always affected by
collapsed cardinality). Also, several «:ref:`material`»
relations can be derived from a single «:ref:`relator`» and «:ref:`mediation`»
relations.

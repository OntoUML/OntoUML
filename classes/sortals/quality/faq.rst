.. _quality-faq-q1:
**Q1:** Can I represent the property "height" as an attribute instead of a «:ref:`quality`»?

.. _quality-faq-a1:
**A1:** Yes. The decision to represent attributes or qualities is entirely up to you. It is useful to represent properties as qualities when you want to define different escales for the same characteristic. For instance, if you want to model that a Person has a "height" property, which can be measured in meters or centimeters you should explicitly represent the Height quality.

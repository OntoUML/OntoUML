Reporting issues
----------------

Found a problem? Any uncertainty? Please create an issue on our GitHub repository `github.com/OntoUML/OntoUML <https://github.com/OntoUML/OntoUML>`__.

Solving issues
--------------

Feel free to solve any issue by yourself. You need just a GitHub account, you will fix the problem in your fork of the repository and then submit a pull request to the original one. Also, you can fork the repository and try to propose your OntoUML changes for the future version.

Documentation guidelines
------------------------

- Keep the file structure, if you want to propose some big changes, please create an issue where we can discuss such big change.
- Do not use line breaks unless ending paragraph. In 21st century all human-usable editors and IDEs have functionality called "word wrap" that is configurable per user. Why should someone with wide screen see only 80 characters per line if want more?
- Try to be consistent, maximize readers understanding (do not expect any IT or Ontology expertise), interlink with other related pages and also label your pages.
- Take a look at `Sphinx docs <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/contents.html>`__ and `reStructuredText Markup Specification <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`__.

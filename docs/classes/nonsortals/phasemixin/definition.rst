A «:ref:`phasemixin`» is the equivalent of «:ref:`phase`» for types that aggregate instances with :ref:`different identity principles <identity>`. A class stereotyped as «:ref:`phasemixin`» is also an :ref:`anti-rigid <rigidity>` type. «:ref:`phasemixin`» is similar semantically to «:ref:`rolemixin`» with the difference in relational dependency.

«:ref:`characterization`» is a relation between a *bearer type* and its *feature*. Feature is intrinsic (inherent) moment of its bearer type, and thus *existentially dependent* on the bearer. Feature may be stereotyped as «:ref:`quality`» or «:ref:`mode`». Feature *characterizes* a bearer type iff every instance of bearer exemplifies the feature.

----------

«:ref:`memberOf`» is a parthood relation between a **functional complex** or a «:ref:`collective`» (as a part) and a «:ref:`collective`» (as a whole).

Examples include:

A. a tree is part of forest;
B. a card is part of a deck of cards;
C. a fork is part of cutlery set;
D. a club member is part of a club.

«:ref:`memberOf`» relation obeys *weak supplementation principle* (at least 2 parts are required, may be of different types). The memberOf relation is **intransitive.**

For example, Kazi, Bobek, Nemo and others are members of the *TJ Sokol Zizkov* Youth Tourist Club. The TJ Sokol Zizkov Youth Tourist Club is the member of the Association of the Youth Tourist Clubs. But Kazi, Bobek, Nemo and others are not members of the Association of the Youth Tourist Clubs, since not persons but only clubs may be members of the association. Although transitivity does not hold across two «:ref:`memberOf`» relations, a «:ref:`memberOf`» relation followed by «:ref:`subCollectionOf`» is transitive.

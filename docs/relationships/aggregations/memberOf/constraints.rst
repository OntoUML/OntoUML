.. _memberOf-constraints-c1:
**C1:** This relation can only represent **essential** parthood if the object representing the whole is **extensional** (i.e. provided that adding or removing of any member changes the identity of the collective). In this case, all parthood relations in which the whole is extensional are constrained as **{essential}** parthood relations.

.. _memberOf-constraints-c2:
**C2:** The classifier connected to the whole end must be a «:ref:`collective`». The classifier connected to the part end can be either a «:ref:`collective`» or **functional complex**.

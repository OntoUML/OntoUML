«:ref:`componentOf`» is a parthood relation between two complexes. Examples include:

A. my hand is part of my arm;
B. a car engine is part of a car;
C. an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) is part of a Central Process Unit (CPU);
D. a heart is part of a circulatory system.

**Transitivity** holds for certain cases but not for others, it depends on context. «:ref:`componentOf`» relation obeys *weak supplementation principle* (at least 2 parts are required, may be of different types).

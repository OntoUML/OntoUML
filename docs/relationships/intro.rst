Introduction
============

**Relations** are entities that glue together other entities. Every relation has a number of **relata** as arguments, which are connected or related by it. The number of a relation’s arguments is called its arity. As much as an unary property such as *being Red,* properties of higher arities such as *being married-to, being heavier-than* are universals, since they can be predicated of a multitude of individuals. Relations can be classified according to the types of their relata. There are relations between sets, between individuals, and between universals, but there are also cross-categorical relations, for example, between urelements and sets or between sets and universals. We divide relations into two broad categories, called :ref:`material` and :ref:`formal` relations. *Formal relations* hold between two or more entities directly without any further intervening individual. Examples of formal relations are:

-  5 is *greater than* 3
-  this day *is part of* this month
-  N is *subset of* Q

but also the relations of instantiation, inherence, quale of a quality, association, existential dependence, among others – ... relations that form the mathematical superstructure of our framework. *Material relations,* conversely, have material structure on their own and include examples such as:

-  employments
-  kisses
-  enrollments
-  flight connections
-  commitments

The relata of a material relation are mediated by individuals that are called :ref:`relators <relator>`.  Relators are individuals with the power of connecting entities:

-  *a flight connection,* for example, founds a relator that connects airports
-  *an enrollment* is a relator that connects a student with an educational institution

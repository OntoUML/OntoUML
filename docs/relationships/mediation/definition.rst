We define a relation of «:ref:`mediation`» between a «:ref:`relator`» and the entities it connects. Mediation is a type of :ref:`existential dependence <dependency>` relation (a form of nonfunctional inherence). It can be derived from the relation between the **relata** and the *qua individiuals* that compose the relator and that inhere in the relata. A «:ref:`relator`» must mediate at least two distinct individuals.
